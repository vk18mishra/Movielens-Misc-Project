# Movie Database Project on Movielens Dataset

This is a functional application "Movie Database", which will work with data in the form of an object model. This object model will be mapped to a relational database, or it will use one of the NoSQL databases to store data. It does not matter whether it is a database in a file (embedded) or a database on a server.
