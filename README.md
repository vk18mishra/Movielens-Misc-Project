# Movie Database Project on Movielens Dataset

**This is a functional application "Movie Database", which will work with data in the form of an object model. This object model will be mapped to a relational database which is MySql to store data. We are using [Movielens-25m](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) dataset for our application and performing different operations on this data. Feel free to check them out in the sidebar.**

**This application is using SQLAlchemy as ORM.**

**This project is written in Python.**

**All this into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.**
